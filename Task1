To develop a **Password Strength Checker** tool, we can implement an algorithm that evaluates several key factors, such as:

1. **Length**: Longer passwords are generally stronger.
2. **Complexity**: The inclusion of a mix of characters, such as:
   - Uppercase letters
   - Lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).
3. **Uniqueness**: Avoid common words, dictionary terms, or simple sequences (like `12345`, `password`, etc.).

Hereâ€™s a Python-based implementation of this Password Strength Checker:

### Plan:
- **Score-based system**: We will assign points based on the presence of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and the length.
- **Feedback**: Provide suggestions based on what is missing in the password.
  
### Example Code:

```python
import re

def check_password_strength(password):
    # Initialize score and feedback
    score = 0
    feedback = []

    # Length check
    if len(password) >= 8:
        score += 2  # Strong points for length
    else:
        feedback.append("Password should be at least 8 characters long.")

    # Uppercase letter check
    if re.search(r"[A-Z]", password):
        score += 1
    else:
        feedback.append("Add at least one uppercase letter.")

    # Lowercase letter check
    if re.search(r"[a-z]", password):
        score += 1
    else:
        feedback.append("Add at least one lowercase letter.")

    # Number check
    if re.search(r"[0-9]", password):
        score += 1
    else:
        feedback.append("Include at least one digit.")

    # Special character check
    if re.search(r"[@$!%*#?&]", password):
        score += 1
    else:
        feedback.append("Include at least one special character (e.g., @, $, #).")

    # Uniqueness check: avoid common patterns or sequences
    common_patterns = ["password", "12345", "qwerty", "letmein", "admin"]
    if any(pattern in password.lower() for pattern in common_patterns):
        feedback.append("Avoid common words or sequences (e.g., 'password', '12345').")
    else:
        score += 1  # Unique password gets a boost

    # Determine strength level based on score
    if score <= 2:
        strength = "Weak"
    elif score <= 4:
        strength = "Moderate"
    else:
        strength = "Strong"

    return {"strength": strength, "score": score, "feedback": feedback}

# Test the function
password = input("Enter a password to check its strength: ")
result = check_password_strength(password)

print(f"Password Strength: {result['strength']}")
print("Feedback: ")
for comment in result['feedback']:
    print(f"- {comment}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Length**: Strong passwords should be at least 8 characters.
2. **Character Mix**: Checks for the inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
3. **Common Patterns**: Avoids common sequences and weak passwords like "password" or "12345."

### Output Example:

For the password `"Passw0rd123!"`, the tool would output something like:
```
Password Strength: Strong
Feedback: 
```

For `"password123"`, it would show:
```
Password Strength: Weak
Feedback:
- Add at least one uppercase letter.
- Include at least one special character (e.g., @, $, #).
- Avoid common words or sequences (e.g., 'password', '12345').
```
